<h1>Aluminum use in transportation</h1>

<p><b>Background</b></p>

<p>Transportation industry is the second largest consumer of aluminum in China. Since the industry is entering into the fast development phase, its consumption of aluminum will be enhanced greatly. In 2010, the aluminum consumption by transportation is 3.48 million tons, accounting for 17-18% of the total aluminum consumption in China. During the “12th Five Year Plan”, the aluminum consumption by transportation industry will be more prosperous!</p>

<p><b>Land transportation</b></p>
<p>During the “11th Five Year Plan”, the annual growth rate of aluminum consumption by domestic automobile manufacturing industry is 20.9%. From 2011 to 2015, the annual growth rate of aluminum alloy consumption by transportation industry is 10%, among which the automobile industry makes the biggest contribution. Given the current trend of going lighter for automobile materials, the application of using aluminum alloy, plate, casting and forging at different parts of automobile is the future research direction. As for track traffic, NDRC approved 25 city track lines, with total investment exceeding trillion RMB; at the meantime, China CNR Corporation announced on 8th of August that, the company has received high speed train order from Siemens. This is the first time that China exports high speed train components to Europe. We believe that 2012 to 2020 will be the golden time for the development of track transportation in China.</p>

<p><b>Aerospace and aviation</b></p>
<p>in next 30-40 years, aluminum will continue to be the main material for the manufacturing of aerospace and aviation equipment. The aluminum sheet is sure to enjoy a fast development. Mr. Xiong Boqing, Vice Dean of Beijing Non-ferrous Metal Research Institute pointed out in April that, “in the current aerospace and aviation industry, “replace casting with sheet material” has become a trend due to the high cost of casting. During the “12th Five Year Plan”, the aluminum industry shall pay more attention to the development of the pre-stretching ultra-thick aluminum alloy products with high strength and low quench sensitivity, and the thickness should be above 150mm or even 200mm. So that the wide application demand by our aerospace and aviation industry will be satisfied.” Currently, we rely on import for the thick sheets. As more and more domestic hot rolling sheet project come on stream, the import will be replaced by domestic production. It’s forecasted that by 2013, the consumption of aviation aluminum thick sheet will reach 0.168 million tons.</p>
